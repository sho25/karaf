Welcome to Apache ServiceMix 4.0!
=================================
Apache ServiceMix is an open source distributed Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)
and SOA toolkit built from the ground up on the semantics and APIs of the Java 
Business Integration (JBI) specification JSR 208 and released under the Apache 
2.0 license.

Apache ServiceMix is lightweight and easily embeddable, has integrated Spring 
support and can be run at the edge of the network (inside a client or server),
as a standalone ESB provider or as a service within another ESB. 
You can use ServiceMix in Java SE or a Java EE application server.
