                  ================================

This is the second milestone of ServiceMix Kernel, but mostly a bug fix release
compared to the first milestone.

** Bug
    * [SMX4KNL-13] - startup issue in recognizing new files in deploy folder
    * [SMX4KNL-15] - Display of memory size using the info command on Windows is ugly
    * [SMX4KNL-16] - Bad error message when startup.properties lists a unknown file (the file name is not displayed, but 'null' instead)
    * [SMX4KNL-18] - No need for DynamicImport-Package=* in filemonitor
    * [SMX4KNL-19] - Performance problems when using the OSGi classloaders in a certain way

** Improvement
    * [SMX4KNL-4] - Add a start option on the 'osgi install' command so that the bundle is automatically started

** Task
    * [SMX4KNL-17] - Remove all the warnings when building the distribution tar.gz
