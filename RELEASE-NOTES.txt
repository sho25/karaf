                  Apache ServiceMix Kernel 1.0-m3
                  ================================

This third milestone of Apache ServiceMix Kernel brings a lot of new features:
  * a provisioning system to install applications easily
  * a log shell to visualize the logging output and change log levels
  * pipe support on commands
  * a bunch of new commands: history, grep, cat, ava, exec, sleep

Note that this milestone does not include the latest spring version because 
the latest ones have wrong OSGi manifest headers and do not work.
