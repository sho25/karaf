h1. MOM (JMS)

The Apache Karaf MOM (Messaging Oriented Middleware/JMS) is an optional enterprise feature.

You have to install the {{jms}} feature first:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install jms
{code}

The {{jms}} feature doesn't install a JMS broker: it just installs the OSGi service, commands, and MBean to interact with
a JMS broker (not the broker itself).

It means that you have to install a JMS broker itself.

This JMS broker can be available:

* outside of Apache Karaf, as a standalone broker. In that case, Apache Karaf JMS will remotely connect to the JMS broker.
 For instance, you can use this topology with Apache ActiveMQ or IBM WebsphereMQ.
* embedded in Apache Karaf. With this topology, Apache Karaf itself provides a JMS broker service. Apache ActiveMQ provides
 a native support in Apache Karaf.

For instance, you can install Apache ActiveMQ directly in Apache Karaf:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:repo-add activemq
Adding feature url mvn:org.apache.activemq/activemq-karaf/LATEST/xml/features
karaf@root()> feature:install activemq-broker
{code}

The {{activemq-broker}} feature installs:

* a Apache ActiveMQ broker directly in Apache Karaf, bind to the {{61616}} port number by default.
* the Apache ActiveMQ WebConsole bound to {{http://0.0.0.0:8181/activemqweb}} by default.

The Apache Karaf {{jms}} feature provides an OSGi service to create/delete JMS connection factories in the container
and perform JMS operations (send or consume messages, get information about a JMS broker, list the destinations, ...).

This JMS OSGi service can be manipulated programmatically (see the developer guide for details), using the {{jms:*}} commands, or using the JMS MBean.

h2. Commands

h3. {{jms:create}}

The {{jms:create}} command creates a JMS connection factory in the Apache Karaf container. It automatically creates a
blueprint XML file in the {{deploy}} folder containing the JMS connection factory definition corresponding
to the type that you mentioned.

The {{jms:create}} command accepts different arguments and options:

{code}
karaf@root()> jms:create --help
DESCRIPTION
        jms:create

        Create a JMS connection factory.

SYNTAX
        jms:create [options] name 

ARGUMENTS
        name
                The JMS connection factory name

OPTIONS
        -u, --url
                The JMS URL. NB: for WebsphereMQ type, the URL is hostname/port/queuemanager/channel
        --help
                Display this help message
        -t, --type
                The JMS connection factory type (ActiveMQ or WebsphereMQ)

{code}

* the {{name}} argument is required. It's the name of the JMS connection factory. The name is used to identify the connection factory, and to create the connection factory definition file ({{deploy/connectionfactory-[name].xml}}).
* the {{-t}} ({{--type}}) option is required. It's the type of the JMS connection factory. Currently on {{activemq}} and {{webspheremq}} type are supported. If you want to use another type of JMS connection factory, you can create the {{deploy/connectionfactory-[name].xml}} file by hand (using one as template).
* the {{-u}} ({{--url}}) option is required. It's the URL used by the JMS connection factory to connect to the broker. If the type is {{activemq}}, the URL looks like {{tcp://localhost:61616}}. If the type is {{webspheremq}}, the URL looks like {{host/port/queuemanager/channel}}.

For instance, to create a JMS connection factory for a Apache ActiveMQ broker, you can do:

{code}
karaf@root()> jms:create -t activemq -u tcp://localhost:61616 test
{code}

{warning}
The {{jms:create}} command doesn't install any feature or bundle providing the JMS connection factory classes (and dependencies).
You have to install the required features (for instance {{activemq-broker}} feature for Apache ActiveMQ), or bundles (for IBM WebsphereMQ) providing the JMS connection factory packages and classes.
{warning}

In the previous example, we assume that you previously installed the {{activemq-broker}} feature.

We can see the created JMS connection factory:

{code}
karaf@root()> la
...
151 | Active   |  80 | 0.0.0                 | connectionfactory-test.xml
{code}

The {{connectionfactory-test.xml}} file has been created in the {{deploy}} folder.

By default, the {{jms:create}} command constructs a JNDI name for the connection factory: {{/jms/[name]}}.

It means that the connection factory name to use for the other {{jms:*}} commands is {{/jms/[name]}}.

h3. {{jms:delete}}

The {{jms:delete}} command deletes a JMS connection factory. The {{name}} argument is the name that you used at creation time:

{code}
karaf@root()> jms:delete test
{code}

h3. {{jms:connectionfactories}}

The {{jms:connectionfactories}} command lists the JMS connection factories:

{code}
karaf@root()> jms:connectionfactories 
JMS Connection Factory
----------------------
/jms/test     
{code}

h3. {{jms:info}}

The {{jms:info}} command provides details about the JMS connection factory:

{code}
karaf@root()> jms:info /jms/test
Property | Value
-------------------
product  | ActiveMQ
version  | 5.9.0
{code}

You can see the JMS broker product and version.

If the JMS broker requires an authentication, you can use the {{-u}} ({{--username}}) and {{-p}} ({{--password}}) options.

h3. {{jms:queues}}

The {{jms:queues}} command lists the JMS queues available on a JMS broker. For instance:

{code}
karaf@root()> jms:queues /jms/test
JMS Queues
----------
MyQueue
{code}

where {{/jms/test}} is the name of the JMS connection factory.

If the JMS broker requires an authentication, you can use the {{-u}} ({{--username}}) and {{-p}} ({{--password}}) options.

{warning}
Depending of the JMS connection factory type, this command may not work.
For now, the command works only with Apache ActiveMQ.
{warning}

h3. {{jms:topics}}

The {{jms:topics}} command lists the JMS topics available on a JMS broker. For instance:

{code}
karaf@root()> jms:topics /jms/test
JMS Topics
----------
MyTopic
{code}

where {{/jms/test}} is the name of the JMS connection factory.

If the JMS broker requires an authentication, you can use the {{-u}} ({{--username}}) and {{-p}} ({{--password}}) options.

{warning}
Depending of the JMS connection factory type, this command may not work.
For now, the command works only with Apache ActiveMQ.
{warning}

h3. {{jms:send}}

The {{jms:send}} command sends a message to a given JMS queue.

For instance, to send a message containing {{Hello World}} in the {{MyQueue}} queue, you can do:

{code}
karaf@root()> jms:send /jms/test MyQueue "Hello World"
{code}

If the JMS broker requires an authentication, you can use the {{-u}} ({{--username}}) and {{-p}} ({{--password}}) options.

h3. {{jms:consume}}

The {{jms:consume}} command consumes messages from a JMS queue.

For instance, to consume all messages from {{MyQueue}}, you can do:

{code}
karaf@root()> jms:consume /jms/test MyQueue
2 message(s) consumed
{code}

If the JMS broker requires an authentication, you can use the {{-u}} ({{--username}}) and {{-p}} ({{--password}}) options.

{warning}
The {{jms:consume}} command just consumes (so removes) messages from a JMS queue. It doesn't display the messages.
If you want to see the details of messages, you can use the {{jms:browse}} command.
{warning}

h3. {{jms:count}}

The {{jms:count}} command counts the number of pending messages into a JMS queue.

For instance, if you want to know the number of messages on {{MyQueue}}, you can do:

{code}
karaf@root()> jms:count /jms/test MyQueue
Messages Count
--------------
8
{code}

If the JMS broker requires an authentication, you can use the {{-u}} ({{--username}}) and {{-p}} ({{--password}}) options.

h3. {{jms:browse}}

The {{jms:browse}} command browses a JMS queue and display details about messages.

For instance, to browse the {{MyQueue}} queue:

{code}

{code}
