\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    This bundle is the core implementation of the Karaf features support.

    Karaf provides a simple, yet flexible, way to provision applications or "features". Such a mechanism is mainly
    provided by a set of commands available in the features shell. The provisioning system uses xml "repositories"
    that define a set of features.
