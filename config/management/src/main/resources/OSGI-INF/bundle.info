h1. Description

The config mbean management bundle exposes a Config MBean that can be used with any JMX client (for instance JConsole).

The config MBean allows quite the same actions that can be performed using config:* commands:
  * list()
  * create(pid)
  * delete(pid)
  * proplist(pid)
  * propdel(pid,key,bypassStorage)
  * propappend(pid,key,value,bypassStorage)
  * propset(pid,key,value,bypassStorage)

    Just as with config:* commands, the Config MBean is able to flush changes into the etc files.
